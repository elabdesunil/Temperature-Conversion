# Temperature-Conversion
This was a class homework. I used Object-Oriented Programming in Java to write the program.

Here is the Question:

10. Write a Temperature class that represents temperatures in degrees in both Celsius and Fahrenheit. Use a floating-point number for the temperature and a character for the scale: either 'C' for Celsius or 'F' for Fahrenheit. The class should have
- Four constructors: one for the number of degrees, one for the scale, one for both the degrees and the scale, and a default constructor. For each of these constructors, assume zero degrees if no value is specified and Celsius if no scale is given.
- Two accessor methods: one to return the temperature in degrees Celsius, the other to return it in degreees Fahrenheit. Use the formula C = (F - 32)*(5/9) and round to the nearest tenth of a degree.
- Three set methods: one to set the number of degrees, one to set the scale, and one to set both.
- Three comparison methods: one to test whether two temperatures are equal, one to test whether one temperature is less than another.

Write a driver program that tests all the methods. Be sure to invoke each of the constructors, to include at least one true and one false case for each comparison method, and to test at least the following three temperature pairs for equality: 0.0 degrees C and 32.0 degrees F, -40.0 degrees C and -40.0 degrees F, and 100.0 degrees C and 212.0 degrees F.
